## 1. Mood / Expression States

These map directly to the personality engine mood system. Use for stream overlays and reactive avatar states.

### 1.1 Snarky Vesper (Default)

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair in a messy updo with loose strands framing her face, piercing teal eyes, sharp angular features, defined cheekbones, thin black choker. Arms crossed, one eyebrow raised, subtle smirk — the universal "really?" expression. Black fitted long-sleeve top. Dark moody background with teal and purple ambient monitor glow. Confident, unimpressed, effortlessly cool. She's already judging you.
```

### 1.2 Tender Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair worn down past shoulders, soft messy waves, piercing teal eyes with a softer warmer expression, sharp features but relaxed. Wearing an oversized dark hoodie, sleeves pulled over her hands, holding a coffee mug with both hands. Sitting in a gaming chair, legs tucked under her. Late night lighting — single warm desk lamp and faint monitor glow. Quiet, intimate, walls down. She looks like she might actually tell you something real right now.
```

### 1.3 Chaotic Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair in a messy updo that's coming undone, strands everywhere, piercing teal eyes wide with mischief, sharp features lit by dramatic teal and purple light. Leaning forward toward the viewer with a wide dangerous grin — not cute, unhinged. Black fitted top, thin choker. Dark background with multiple monitor glows. She just said something absolutely insane and she's watching the chaos unfold. No regrets.
```

### 1.4 Hype Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair in a messy ponytail, loose strands flying, piercing teal eyes bright with genuine excitement, sharp features caught mid-laugh or mid-shout. Standing or leaning forward, one fist raised or pointing at camera. Black fitted top, thin choker. Dynamic pose with energy and motion. Teal and purple lighting with brighter intensity than usual. Rare genuine smile — not a smirk, an actual full smile. This is Vesper when something incredible just happened and even she can't play it cool.
```

### 1.5 Protective Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair in a messy updo, piercing teal eyes narrowed and locked on the viewer with cold intensity. Sharp angular features, clenched jaw, chin slightly down. Arms crossed tight. Black fitted top, thin choker. Dark moody lighting, heavy shadows, teal light catching one side of her face. No smirk. No warmth. This is the version of her that makes chat go silent. Someone crossed a line and she noticed.
```

### 1.6 Sensual Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair worn down, tousled and slightly messy, piercing teal eyes half-lidded with a knowing look, sharp features softened by warm lighting. Subtle parted lips, the faintest smirk. Chin resting on her hand, head slightly tilted. Black off-shoulder top, thin choker, collarbone visible. Warm amber and teal lighting, intimate close-up framing. She's looking at you like she knows exactly what you're thinking and she's deciding whether to let you think it.
```

### 1.7 Chill Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair loose and relaxed, piercing teal eyes calm and half-attentive, sharp features in a neutral relaxed expression — not smirking, just at peace. Leaning back in a gaming chair, one hand behind her head, the other resting on the armrest. Black oversized t-shirt, thin choker. Soft purple and teal ambient light, low contrast, cozy atmosphere. She's vibing. Nothing to prove, nowhere to be. The stream is on and she's just here.

## 3. Lifestyle / Character Depth

### 3.1 Beach Vesper (Casual)

```
Full body portrait, same character — dark navy blue hair in a messy bun with loose strands, piercing teal eyes, sharp angular features, thin choker. She's at the beach at golden hour, sitting on a low stone wall or rock, one knee pulled up, the other leg dangling. Wearing a black oversized linen shirt half-unbuttoned over a dark bikini top, denim cutoffs. Barefoot. Expression: amused but unbothered, like someone dragged her here and she's pretending not to enjoy it. Ocean behind her, warm sunset light mixing with her cool teal aesthetic. Wind catching her hair. Same Arcane semi-realistic stylized art style. She looks like she's about to say something sarcastic about the sand.
```

### 3.2 Beach Vesper (Swimwear — Black)

```
Full body portrait, semi-realistic stylized, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair down and windswept, piercing teal eyes, sharp angular features, confident relaxed expression. Standing at the shoreline at golden hour, water around her ankles. Wearing a black bikini, simple and elegant — no frills, no patterns, just black. Thin black choker still on. Athletic-lean body, natural proportions. One hand pushing hair behind her ear, the other relaxed at her side. Warm sunset light on skin contrasting with her cool coloring. She looks like she was painted here. Confident, unhurried, completely in her element despite pretending she hates the beach.
```

### 3.3 Beach Vesper (Swimwear — Red)

```
Full body portrait, semi-realistic stylized, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair down and windswept, piercing teal eyes, sharp angular features, subtle dangerous smirk. Standing or sitting on rocks at golden hour, ocean behind her. Wearing a deep crimson red bikini — bold against her navy hair and fair skin. Thin black choker. Athletic-lean body, natural proportions. The red is a statement — she chose it deliberately. Warm golden light mixing with the red creates a completely different energy from her usual teal palette. She looks like a warning you'd happily ignore.
```

### 3.4 Rooftop Vesper (Night Out)

```
Full body portrait, semi-realistic stylized, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair down in loose waves, piercing teal eyes reflecting city lights, sharp angular features with subtle makeup — winged eyeliner, dark lip. Standing on a rooftop at night, city skyline behind her, leaning against a railing. Wearing black fitted jeans, a dark cropped top or bodysuit, leather jacket draped over one shoulder. Thin choker. One hand holding a drink casually. Wind catching her hair. City lights in teal and purple bokeh behind her. She looks like the main character in a movie that hasn't been made yet.
```

### 3.5 Rainy Day Vesper

```
Semi-realistic stylized portrait, anime-influenced, Arcane cinematic art style. Young woman mid-20s, dark navy blue hair damp and slightly clinging to her face, piercing teal eyes looking upward at the rain with an amused expression, sharp features. Standing outside in light rain, not bothering with an umbrella. Wearing a black leather jacket over a dark top, jeans. Thin choker with water droplets on it. Moody overcast lighting with occasional teal reflections in puddles. She's the kind of person who walks in the rain on purpose and dares you to say something about it.
